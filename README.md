#### My excuse
I was reading the liberated pixel style guide at [opengameart.org](http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/styleguide.html) and came across a link to [Making Dungeons Pretty, Part II](docs/Making-Dungeons-Pretty-Part-II) which 404ed.

I found it on the internet archive but the site had been in various states of 404 for years. I'm pretty sure the creator still maintains a presence and publishes game related stuff so maybe he would like to know about this. Perhaps someone will tell him.

Anyway, after hunting down the missing images in google cache I decided a github repo was the quickest way to assemble a simple recreation of the page and so I did, which was the previous `README.md`.

Following some links on the internet archive's copy of the page yielded better results but I think I will mirror a few more articles here for the sake of their interesting nature and to keep them alive.
